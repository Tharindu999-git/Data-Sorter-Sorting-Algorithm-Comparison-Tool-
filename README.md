##CIT300 Practical Assignment 2  
## Sorting Algorithm Comparison Tool  

This project is a **console-based Java application** developed to compare the performance of three sorting algorithms — **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** — based on **execution time** and **step count**.  

It demonstrates how different algorithmic complexities affect performance when sorting user-defined or randomly generated datasets.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main goals of this project are to:  
1. Accept a list of numbers from the user or generate a random dataset.  
2. Sort the list using multiple algorithms.  
3. Measure and display execution time and step count for each algorithm.  
4. Compare algorithm performance in a clear results table.  
5. Provide a simple, menu-driven interface for ease of use.
